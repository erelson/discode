# PTY Rust Replacement Checklists (Zellij-Structure Aligned)

Goal: fully replace `pty-ts` with `pty-rust`, align runtime internals with Zellij-style boundaries (`PTY bus -> terminal model -> screen/renderer -> IPC`), and provide a full migration track from TypeScript daemon to Rust daemon.

## Target Architecture Checklist (Zellij-style)

- [ ] sidecar has explicit modules: `pty_bus`, `terminal_pane`, `grid_scrollback`, `screen`, `renderer`, `session_manager`, `rpc`
- [ ] PTY read/write lives only in `pty_bus` (no direct PTY access from RPC handlers)
- [ ] ANSI/VT parse and state updates live in `terminal_pane` + `grid_scrollback`
- [ ] `screen` owns viewport/frame assembly and cursor metadata
- [ ] `renderer` produces deterministic `TerminalStyledFrame` and patch diffs
- [ ] `session_manager` owns window lifecycle, status, env, and process metadata
- [ ] RPC layer is transport only (decode -> command -> encode), no business logic leakage
- [ ] sidecar exposes a stable command/event contract independent of transport details

## Final Product State Checklist

- [ ] `runtimeMode` surface is `tmux | pty-rust`
- [ ] legacy `pty` and `pty-ts` inputs normalize to `pty-rust`
- [ ] `PtyRustRuntime` contains no TS fallback branch
- [ ] Rust sidecar is the only PTY engine for PTY runtime mode
- [ ] daemon control plane is Rust in production (or TypeScript compatibility shim only)
- [ ] docs/onboarding remove PoC and experimental wording

## Phase 0 - Architecture Contract and Gap Audit

- [x] publish architecture map from current PoC to target Zellij-like modules (`docs/PTY_RUST_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`)
- [x] define ownership rules for each module boundary (`docs/PTY_RUST_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`)
- [x] list all current RPC methods and map each to command handler modules (`docs/PTY_RUST_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`)
- [x] define migration policy: no feature additions outside replacement scope (`docs/PTY_RUST_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`)
- [x] create risk list: VT fidelity, stream latency, platform parity, lifecycle races (`docs/PTY_RUST_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`)

Exit criteria:

- [ ] architecture contract document approved
- [ ] module ownership and coding rules agreed

## Phase 1 - Sidecar Skeleton Refactor (No Behavior Change)

- [x] create module tree in `sidecar/pty-rust/src/` (`pty_bus`, `terminal_pane`, `grid_scrollback`, `screen`, `renderer`, `session_manager`, `rpc`)
- [x] move window/session state out of `main.rs` into `session_manager` (state structs/registry + locking/window access helpers moved)
- [x] move PTY spawn/read/write/resize into `pty_bus` (`spawn_window_process`, `write_input`, `resize_window`, `stop_window`, `dispose_window`)
- [x] move VT-lite parser logic into `terminal_pane` + `grid_scrollback` (kept `vt_lite` as compatibility adapter)
- [ ] keep existing RPC methods working via adapters
- [ ] add integration tests to prove behavior equivalence after moves

Exit criteria:

- [ ] `main.rs` is thin bootstrap + transport wiring only
- [ ] refactor passes all pre-existing sidecar/runtime tests

## Phase 2 - Runtime Transport and Execution Model Hardening

- [ ] replace request-per-process client pattern with persistent RPC connection model
- [ ] introduce request ids, timeouts, and explicit error codes
- [ ] implement sidecar heartbeat/health method
- [ ] add controlled shutdown and socket/pipe cleanup guarantees
- [ ] add observability: per-method latency/error counters and sidecar startup metrics

Exit criteria:

- [ ] no per-request `spawnSync` in steady state path
- [ ] request tail latency improves versus PoC baseline

## Phase 3 - Terminal Engine Fidelity (Zellij-like terminal pane behavior)

- [ ] implement robust parser state machine for split/incomplete sequences
- [ ] harden cursor movement, wrapping, scroll region, save/restore, reverse index
- [ ] harden alt-screen enter/leave transitions and cursor visibility behavior
- [ ] implement wide/combining char width correctness in grid writes
- [ ] define and implement query-response policy for supported terminal queries
- [ ] build regression fixtures from real agent outputs

Exit criteria:

- [ ] fixture pass rate reaches target threshold
- [ ] no known blocker in interactive agent CLIs

## Phase 4 - Screen and Renderer Separation

- [ ] `screen` module owns frame composition from pane/grid state
- [ ] `renderer` owns style segment compaction and patch-diff calculation
- [ ] define deterministic frame/patch emission rules for unchanged/changed states
- [ ] add backpressure/coalescing policy for burst output
- [ ] validate cursor/frame consistency under rapid resize

Exit criteria:

- [ ] stream tests pass under burst + resize stress
- [ ] frame generation cost is within budget

## Phase 5 - Session and Window Lifecycle Reliability

- [ ] implement explicit window lifecycle state transitions (`idle/starting/running/exited/error`)
- [ ] guarantee idempotent start/stop and clear error behavior on repeated calls
- [ ] ensure process exit detection updates state and emits expected events
- [ ] ensure environment propagation rules are deterministic per session/window
- [ ] add lifecycle race tests (start-stop, rapid resize, dispose during I/O)

Exit criteria:

- [ ] lifecycle tests pass with race-focused stress runs
- [ ] no leaked PTY children or stale sockets in test runs

## Phase 6 - Cross-Platform Runtime Completion

- [ ] implement Windows transport parity (named pipe)
- [ ] verify PTY backend parity behavior on macOS/Linux/Windows
- [ ] provide sidecar binaries for all supported platforms
- [ ] validate binary discovery/override path behavior per OS
- [ ] run CI matrix with e2e runtime suites

Exit criteria:

- [ ] `pty-rust` is production-usable across supported OSes

## Phase 7 - Node Integration Cutover

- [ ] update runtime factory/mode resolution to make `pty-rust` primary PTY backend
- [ ] remove TS fallback code from `src/runtime/pty-rust-runtime.ts`
- [ ] keep TypeScript daemon API surfaces unchanged for callers
- [ ] normalize config/CLI inputs: `pty`/`pty-ts` -> `pty-rust`
- [ ] update CLI/TUI labels and help text
- [ ] update architecture and runtime docs to new structure

Exit criteria:

- [ ] upgraded and fresh installs run PTY mode through sidecar only

## Phase 8 - Canary Rollout with SLO Gates

- [ ] define SLOs: crash rate, frame mismatch rate, input RTT, memory/CPU ceilings
- [ ] ship canary release with enhanced telemetry
- [ ] rollout progression: 10% -> 50% -> 100% only after gate pass
- [ ] keep emergency switch only between `tmux` and `pty-rust`
- [ ] monitor one full release cycle post-100%

Exit criteria:

- [ ] SLOs are stable for full rollout window

## Phase 9 - Remove `pty-ts` and Cleanup

- [ ] remove remaining `pty-ts` implementation and references from runtime code
- [ ] remove/update tests that depend on old TS runtime internals
- [ ] remove `pty-ts` mentions from CLI/docs/help/onboarding
- [ ] remove obsolete compatibility shims no longer needed
- [ ] run full test + e2e suites and fix final regressions

Exit criteria:

- [ ] no production/runtime code path references `pty-ts`
- [ ] project docs and tests reflect `tmux | pty-rust` model

## Operational Checklist During Implementation

- [ ] after runtime code changes, restart daemon:
  - [ ] `discode-src daemon stop`
  - [ ] `discode-src daemon start`
  - [ ] `discode-src daemon status`
- [ ] document user-visible migration notes in release notes/changelog
- [ ] confirm release checklist items in `AGENTS.md` when shipping
